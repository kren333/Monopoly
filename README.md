# Monopoly

A program that runs a 10,000-turn simulation of a Monopoly game, tracking the number of times each square has been landed on as well as the amount of money the player has paid in rent to each square. Code was written to answer the question, "which locations are most visited in Monopoly"? According to this program, in the long run, areas 5-10 squares after the jail square tend to be visited proportionally more often.
